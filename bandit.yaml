### Bandit Configuration File
# Used to exclude virtual environments, tests, and suppress common false positives.

# Exclude directories and files from the scan
exclude_dirs:
  - .venv
  - tests
  - __pycache__
  - .mypy_cache
  - .pytest_cache
  - .git

# Specific file patterns to exclude
skips:
  - B101  # Use of assert detected (standard in tests, and common in this project)
  - B404  # Import subprocess (widely used for system control in this project)
  - B603  # subprocess.Popen with shell=False (safe for our specific internal use cases)
  - B311  # Standard random module (used for non-security relevant features like UI effects)

# Override default behavior to skip test files if they are in the root
# (Bandit sometimes picks up test_*.py even if excluded via dirs)
exclude:
  - test_*.py
